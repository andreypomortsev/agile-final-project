# scrum-zenhub
As the product owner, I will create stories for the team and organize them into a product backlog. As the scrum master, I will create a sprint milestone and ensure that a subset of the stories is ready to be placed in the sprint plan. As the developer, I will create the sprint backlog and simulate a sprint by moving stories across the kanban board.
